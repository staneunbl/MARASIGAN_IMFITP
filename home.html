								<td colspan=3> The Philippines is the only country in Southeast 
								Asia that was subjected to Western colonization before it had the opportunity 
								to develop either a centralized government ruling over a large territory or a 
								dominant culture. In ancient times the inhabitants of the Philippines were a diverse
								agglomeration of peoples who arrived in various waves of immigration from the Asian
								mainland and who maintained little contact with each other. Contact with Chinese
								traders was recorded in 982, and some cultural influences from South Asia, such 
								as a Sanskrit-based writing system, were carried to the islands by the Indonesian 
								empires of Srivijaya (7th–13th century) and Majapahit (13th–16th century); but in
								comparison with other parts of the region, the influence of both China and India on
								the Philippines was of little importance. The peoples of the Philippine archipelago,
								unlike most of the other peoples of Southeast Asia, never adopted Hinduism or Buddhism. &copy; https://www.britannica.com/place/Philippines#ref23724 </td>

								<td colspan=3> According to what can be inferred from somewhat later accounts, 
								the Filipinos of the 15th century must have engaged primarily in shifting cultivation,
								hunting, and fishing. Sedentary cultivation was the exception. Only in the mountains of 
								northern Luzon, where elaborate rice terraces were built some 2,000 years ago, were 
								livelihood and social organization linked to a fixed territory. The lowland peoples 
								lived in extended kinship groups known as barangays, each under the leadership of a 
								datu, or chieftain. The barangay, which ordinarily numbered no more than a few hundred
								individuals, was usually the largest stable economic and political unit. &copy; https://www.britannica.com/place/Philippines/Sports-and-recreation#ref214501 </td>

								provinces around Manila. After months of fighting, severe Spanish retaliation forced the
								revolutionary armies to retreat to the hills. In December 1897 a truce was concluded with
								the Spanish. Emilio Aguinaldo, a municipal mayor and commander of the rebel forces, was
								paid a large sum and was allowed to go to Hong Kong with other leaders; the Spanish promised
								reforms as well. But reforms were slow in coming, and small bands of rebels, distrustful of
								Spanish promises, kept their arms; clashes grew more frequent. &copy; https://www.britannica.com/place/Philippines/Sports-and-recreation#ref214501  </td>

								the last defense against the rising disorder caused by increasingly violent student
								demonstrations, the alleged threats of communist insurgency by the new Communist Party
								of the Philippines (CPP), and the Muslim separatist movement of the Moro National Liberation
								Front (MNLF). One of his first actions was to arrest opposition politicians in Congress and
								the Constitutional Convention. Initial public reaction to martial law was mostly favourable
								except in Muslim areas of the south, where a separatist rebellion, led by the MNLF, broke out
								in 1973. Despite halfhearted attempts to negotiate a cease-fire, the rebellion continued to
								claim thousands of military and civilian casualties. Communist insurgency expanded with the
								creation of the National Democratic Front (NDF), an organization embracing the CPP and other

								24 percent of the overall vote. Ramos was a former army chief of staff and defense minister
								under Aquino; he was unpopular in some quarters because he had headed the agency charged with
								enforcing martial law under Marcos before turning against Marcos to give crucial support to
								Aquino in 1986. Some observers had wryly noted during the election that the winner might come
								to envy the losers, and indeed Ramos inherited the onus of having to deal with insurgencies
								from the right and the left, a severe energy crisis that produced daily electricity outages,
								an infrastructure in decay, a large foreign debt, and the troubles of a population half of

								<td colspan=5> Philippine society is a unique blend of diversity and homogeneity. Although geographically
								part of Southeast Asia, the country is culturally strongly Euro-American. Forces of assimilation have constantly
								worked to overcome cultural differences between the various ethnic groups that are scattered—sometimes in relative
								isolation—throughout the archipelago. Nearly four centuries of Western rule, however, have left an indelible 
								imprint on the Philippines, serving as a conduit for the introduction of Western culture and as the catalyst 
								for the emergence of a sense of Philippine political and cultural unity. While the Christian churches built by 
								the Spanish and the mosques built by the Muslims provided a spiritual anchor, the educational system established
								by the United States and expanded by the Filipinos has become emblematic of cultural unity and socioeconomic progress.
								Nonetheless, through the persistence of strong family ties, the revival of the barangay as the smallest unit of
								government, increased attention to Asian history and literature, and subsequent revival of dormant traditions, 
								the Philippines has strengthened its Asian heritage without abandoning its Western cultural acquisitions. &copy; https://www.britannica.com/place/Philippines/Cultural-life </td>

								religious and other national holidays. Among the religious holidays officially observed in the Philippines are

					  <div class="desc"> <b> <h2>  Magpupungko Rock Pools </h2> </b> 
					  <p align ="justify"> Magpupungko Rock Pools is a great spot for cliff jumping, swimming,
					  and exploring. From General Luna, where most of the tourist accommodations are, it’s just a
					  45-minute motorbike ride. Its formation is unbelievably beautiful but there is a catch though.
					  Some days, Magpupungko is closed to tourists so be sure to check before you make the trip there.
					  And before going there, make sure what you prefer more because the area gives unique experiences
					  during the low tide and high tide. &copy; https://www.zenrooms.com/blog/tourist-spots-in-mindanao/ </p>

					  buko (coconut) juice. You can ask locals to cook fresh seafood and enjoy it on a boodle fight! And unlike the other
					  two beaches mentioned, there are a lot more things to do in Daku Island from kayaking to fishing. Daku is one of the three islands part of island hopping
					  tours together with Naked Island and Guyam Island. &copy; https://www.zenrooms.com/blog/tourist-spots-in-mindanao/ </p>
